# Dominic's Prework Study Guide:

## Description

As it is the first webpage created by myself, I am not only using it as an opportunity to practice what I've recently learned, but also as it's namesake - a study guide.

## Usage

A reference point for the fundamentals of web development. See ctrl+shift+i to witness the effect of a small bit of javascript we added - or to adhere to that script's purpose; helping to choose a topic of study.  

## Credits

Thank you to UC Berkeley Extention: Web dev coding bootcamp for the prework which helped forge this study guide.
